Welcome to the Selendra wiki, the hub for those interested in learning, building, or running a node on the Selendra protocol. The wiki is sectioned into three major sections to cater to each of these different actors in the Selendra ecosystem. If you're eager to start building your project to connect to Selendra, see the [build section](#want-to-build-on-selendra). If you're interested in operating a node, head on over to the [maintain section](#want-to-run-a-node). And, if you want to learn more then peruse the [learn section](#want-to-learn-more) below.
