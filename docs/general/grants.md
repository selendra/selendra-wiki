### Selendra Treasury

The Selendra Treasury is a pot of on-chain funds collected through transaction fees, slashing,
staking inefficiencies, etc. The funds held in the treasury can be spent on spending proposals. 
Selendra offers everyone the opportunity to apply for funding via the treasury. See:
