SNS (Selendra Name Service) is a distributed and open system of smart contracts on the Hydranet
blockchain which allows users to claim domain names like `gwen.sel`.

The SNS is a domain that is equivalent to a DNS (Domain Name System) domain. Instead, it offers a
decentralized and secure way to translate text via smart contracts. Supporting wallets can then
allow senders to input SNS domains instead of long and unwieldy addresses. This prevents phishing,
fraud, typos, and adds a layer of usability on top of the regular wallet user experience.
