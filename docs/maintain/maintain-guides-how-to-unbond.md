The following content describes how to stop nominating or validating and retrieve your stake. Please
note that all networks on which you can nominate have a delayed exit period, called the _unbonding
period_, which serves as a cooldown. You will not be able to transfer your tokens before this period
has elapsed, and you will not receive any staking rewards during this period (as you are not
nominating any validators).
