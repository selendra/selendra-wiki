## Preliminaries

Running a validator on a live network is a lot of responsibility! You will be accountable for not
only your own stake, but also the stake of your current nominators. If you make a mistake and get
slashed, your money and your reputation will be at risk. However, running a validator can also be
very rewarding, knowing that you contribute to the security of a decentralized network while growing
your stash.

:::warning

It is highly recommended that you have significant system administration experience before
attempting to run your own validator.

You must be able to handle technical issues and anomalies with your node which you must be able to
tackle yourself. Being a validator involves more than just executing the Polkadot binary.
