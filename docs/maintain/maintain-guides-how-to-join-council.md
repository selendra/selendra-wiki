The council is an elected body of on-chain accounts that are intended to represent the passive
stakeholders of Polkadot and/or Kusama. The council has two major tasks in governance: proposing
referenda and vetoing dangerous or malicious referenda. For more information on the council, see the
[governance page](../learn/learn-governance.md#council). This guide will walk you through entering
your candidacy to the council.
