The public referenda chamber is one of the three bodies of on-chain governance as it's instantiated
in Polkadot and Kusama. The other two bodies are the
[council](maintain-guides-how-to-join-council.md) and the
[technical committee](../learn/learn-governance.md#technical-committee).

Public referenda can be proposed and voted on by any token holder in the system as long as they
provide a bond. After a proposal is made, others can agree with it by _endorsing_ it and putting up
tokens equal to the original bond. During every launch period, the most endorsed proposal will be
moved to the public referenda table where it can be voted upon. Voters who are willing to lock up
their tokens for a greater duration of time can do so and get their votes amplified. For more
details on the governance system please see [here](../learn/learn-governance.md).
