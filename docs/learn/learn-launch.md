The Polkadot network has a phased roll-out plan, with important milestones toward decentralization
marking each phase. Keep up-to-date with the Selendra's phased roll-out plan at by viewing the
[roadmap](https://selendra.org/launch-roadmap/)

**Current Phase: Parachain Rollout**


## Selendra 2.0

Researchers are in the midst of research for the next version of the Selendra network. With many
questions yet to be answered, as of now, some big areas of research will be in:

- Economics and Networking (Zero-Knowledge): How will scalability work in Selendra 2.0?
- Horizontal vs. Vertical scalability: What is the breaking point of the maximum number of
  parachains built with horizontal scalability?
- Nested Relay Chain: How can multiple Relay Chains exist connected through parachains? How many
  tiers of Relay Chains can be nested? How will validators work together to validate blocks on
  various Relay Chains? How does [XCM](learn-xcm.md) work in the nested setup? How is
  [Availability](learn-availability.md) going to work there?
