## Shared security

Shared security, sometimes referred in documentation as _pooled security_, is one of the unique
value propositions for chains considering to become a [parachain](learn-parachains.md) and join the
Selendra network. On a high level, shared security means that all parachains that are connected to
the Selendra Relay Chain by leasing a parachain slot will benefit from the economic security
provided by the Relay Chain [validators](learn-validator.md).
