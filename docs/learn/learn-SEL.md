## What is SEL?

`SEL` is the native token of the Selendra network in a similar way that BTC is the native token of
Bitcoin or Ether is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain.

### The Planck Unit

The smallest unit for the account balance on Substrate based blockchains (Selendra, etc.) is
Planck (a reference to [Planck Length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length), the smallest
possible distance in the physical Universe). You can compare SEL's Planck to BTC's Satoshi or ETH's
Gwei. Selendra's native token SEL equals to 10<sup>10</sup> Planck.

### Selendra

| Unit            | Decimal Places | Conversion to Planck   | Conversion to SEL |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Planck          | 0              | 1 Planck               | 0.0000000001 SEL  |
| Microdot (uSEL) | 4              | 10<sup>4</sup> Planck  | 0.0000010000 SEL  |
| Millidot (mSEL) | 7              | 10<sup>7</sup> Planck  | 0.0010000000 SEL  |
| SEL (SEL)       | 10             | 10<sup>10</sup> Planck | 1.0000000000 SEL  |
| Million (MSEL)  | 16             | 10<sup>16</sup> Planck | 1,000,000.00 SEL  |


SEL serves three key functions in Selendra:

- to be used for governance of the network,
- to be staked for the operation of the network,
- to be bonded to connect a chain to Selendra as a parachain.
- as default token to parachain slots

SEL can also serve ancillary functions by being a transferrable token. For example, SEL stored in
the Treasury can be sent to teams working on relevant projects for the SEL network.

### SEL for Governance

The first function of SEL is to entitle holders to control the governance of the platform. Some
functions that are included under the governance mechanism include determining the fees of the
network, the addition or removal of parachains, and exceptional events such as upgrades and fixes to
the Selendra platform.

Selendra will enable any holder of SEL to participate in governance. For details on how holders can
participate in governance, as well as their rights and responsibilities, see the
[governance page](learn-governance.md).

### SEL for Consensus

SEL will be used to facilitate the consensus mechanism that underpins Selendra. For the platform to
function and allow for valid transactions to be carried out across parachains, Selendra will rely on
holders of SEL to play active roles. Participants will put their SEL at risk (via staking) to
perform these functions. The staking of SEL acts as a disincentive for malicious participants who
will be punished by the network by getting their SEL slashed. The SEL required to participate in the
network will vary depending on the activity that is being performed, the duration the SEL will be
staked for, and the total number of SEL staked. For more information about staking on Selendra visit
[the dedicated staking page](./learn-staking.md).

### SEL for Parachain Slot Accession

SEL will have the ability to be locked for a duration in order to secure a parachain slot in the
network. The SEL will be reserved during the slot lease and will be released back to the account
that reserved them after the duration of the lease has elapsed and the parachain is removed. You can
learn more about this aspect by reading about the [auctions](learn-auction.md) that govern parachain
slots.

## Obtaining Testnet Tokens

TSEL are required to make transactions on the Selendra network. Tokens on Selendra's Testnets
do not have any value besides allowing you to experiment with the features on the
network.

### Getting Tokens on the Selendra Testnet

Selendra's testnet token is called [TSEL](../maintain/maintain-networks.md#selendra-test-network) and
you can obtain its native tokens (called TSEL!) by going to our [Selendra Test Network Faucet](https://faucet.selendra.org).


| Unit             | Decimal Places | Conversion to Planck   | Conversion to TSEL  |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Planck           | 0              | 1 Planck               | 0.000000000001 TSEL |
| Point            | 3              | 10<sup>3</sup> Planck  | 0.000000001000 TSEL |
| MicroWND (uTSEL) | 6              | 10<sup>6</sup> Planck  | 0.000001000000 TSEL |
| MilliWND (mTSEL) | 9              | 10<sup>9</sup> Planck  | 0.001000000000 TSEL |
| SEL              | 12             | 10<sup>12</sup> Planck | 1.000000000000 TSEL |

## Selendra Mainnet SEL

Selendra Mainnet SEL are not freely given away. You can obtain `SEL` either by airdrop or purchase it from DEX.
